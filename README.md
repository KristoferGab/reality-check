## Design
---
### Color Scheme

The color scheme was chosen by using the eye dropper tool from Chrome dev-tools on the hero image. Since the image was chosen first the theme was built around this color palettes. 

It was checked on [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%232E4159&sub=1) to ensure that the gradients where matching. Also some #hex colors where taken from the Love Running project delivered by Code Institute (off-white and dark-grey). 


### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the chosen fonts to create a modern tech look:
- Roboto Mono is used as headings and for the form submit button
- Rubik is used for all other text in the body
- Sans-serif is the backup font
[Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) was used to find a good font pairing with Roboto Mono.

### Imagery
All images was taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) free library and all pictures used are credited bellow with the name of the kind photographers that share their work for free. 

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using the program Balsamiq for desktop use.

- Using aria-labels for iframes.
- Using alternative descriptive attributes for all images used.
- Hide FontAwesome on icons that are not important for screenreaders to read.
- Ensuring sufficient contrast throughout the color schemes.
- Fixing navbar at top of screen so that it is always possible to find the right information.

## __Testing__ 
---
This website is built for Desktop viewing in mind and is therefor optimized for this purpose. Testing has been done during the developments different stages with lighthouse as a main resource to ensure the best performance possible at the same time as accessibility and best practices are followed and adhered to. Chrome dev-tools was the main source for designing the site where the Inspect window was constantly being observed to ensure the intended results. 

This is the final result for the deployed website:
![Lighthouse Test 100%](assets/images/readme-img/lighthouse-results-desktop-reality-check-100.JPG)

In the beginning the results on performance was very poor. Around 75% was all it could muster and a lot of editing where made to ensure that this reached 100%. Some changes made to reach this:
- Lazy loading images
- Resizing images that were to large.
- Change format from jpg to webp.
- Lazy load iframes
- Change iframes to only load on click and instead just show an image of the video

While desktop was the focus for the build, media queries have been added to make sure that it works on other devices as well, such as tablet and mobile. Due to the fixed navbar, detailed section, summary section, and to ensure high UX on different sized devices, as many as seven media queries were made. It works end responds well on different sizes but is not intended do be used on small mobile devices primarily.

Even if the function is there on mobile devices it loses its performance, mostly due to image sizes optimized for desktop as can be seen on the image below. Also SEO is slightly less because of the small size on the checkboxes on the form.

### Validator Testing 

This one page site has been run through the W3C validator for HTML and the Jigsaw validator for CSS.

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkristofergab.github.io%2Freality-check%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [W3C (Jigsaw) validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fkristofergab.github.io%2Freality-check%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

### Known Bugs

After testing on Safari a few bugs were discovered:
- The sites logos inner radius is squared instead of round. This is because the css command outline is not yet released.
- When rotating the scaling of the detailed section is not correct and the iframes overlap underlying section.

### Unfixed Bugs

Issues mentioned under Known Bugs section related to Safari is yet to be fixed. The outline issue is deemed acceptable. However, the overlapping issue is something that has to be handled in future release but accepted for now since it is fully functional in normal reading mode (not rotated).
